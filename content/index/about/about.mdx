I started out in fashion design and product development. Creativity and design have always been central to my passion in life and are the reason why I love frontend development so much.

My transition into software engineering came from my admiration of women who could code. It seemed like such a useful skill and women who code are so cool to me.

After hitting a bit of a career wall, I decided there was no better time than the present to start learning how to code. Almost a year later, and here I am!
